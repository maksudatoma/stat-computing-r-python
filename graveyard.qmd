## Mathematical Logic {#sec-math-logic}

In @sec-data-struct and @sec-control-struct we talk about more complicated data structures and control structures (for loops, if statements). 
I've included this section because it may be useful to review some concepts from mathematical logic.

Unfortunately, to best demonstrate mathematical logic, I'm going to need you to know that a vector is like a list of the same type of thing. 
In R, vectors are defined using `c()`, so `c(1, 2, 3)` produces a vector with entries 1, 2, 3. 
In Python, we'll primarily use `numpy` arrays, which we create using `np.array([1, 2, 3])`. 
Technically, this is creating a list, and then converting that list to a numpy array. 


### And, Or, and Not

We can combine logical statements using and, or, and not.

- (X AND Y) requires that both X and Y are true.
- (X OR Y) requires that one of X or Y is true.
- (NOT X) is true if X is false, and false if X is true. Sometimes called **negation**.

In R, we use `!` to symbolize NOT, in Python, we use `~` for vector-wise negation (NOT).

Order of operations dictates that NOT is applied before other operations. So `NOT X AND Y` is read as `(NOT X) AND (Y)`. You must use parentheses to change the way this is interpreted.

#### R

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

x & y # AND
x | y # OR
!x & y # NOT X AND Y
x & !y # X AND NOT Y
```

#### Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([True, False, True, False])
y = np.array([True, True, False, False])

x & y
x | y
~x & y
x & ~y
```

### De Morgan's Laws

[De Morgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) are a set of rules for how to combine logical statements. You can represent them in a number of ways:

-   NOT(A or B) is equivalent to NOT(A) and NOT(B)
-   NOT(A and B) is equivalent to NOT(A) or NOT(B)

::: panel-tabset
We can also represent them with Venn Diagrams.

#### Definitions

Suppose that we set the convention that ![Shaded regions are TRUE, unshaded regions are FALSE](images/other/TrueFalse.png).

#### DeMorgan's First Law

#### DeMorgan's Second Law

## Controlling Loops with Break, Next, Continue {#sec-controlling-loops}

<!-- https://www.py4e.com/html3/05-iterations -->

<!-- https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/break-next/ -->

Sometimes it is useful to control the statements in a loop with a bit more precision. 
You may want to skip over code and proceed directly to the next iteration, or, as demonstrated in the previous section with the `break` statement, it may be useful to exit the loop prematurely.

### Break Statement

![A break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely](images/other/break-statement.png)

### Next/Continue Statement 

![A next (or continue) statement is used to skip the body of the loop and continue to the next iteration](images/other/next-statement-flow.png)


::: callout-warning
### Example: Next/continue and Break statements
Let's demonstrate the details of next/continue and break statements.

We can do different things based on whether i is evenly divisible by 3, 5, or both 3 and 5 (thus divisible by 15)

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
for (i in 1:20) {
  if (i %% 15 == 0) {
    print("Exiting now")
    break
  } else if (i %% 3 == 0) {    
    print("Divisible by 3")
    next
    print("After the next statement") # this should never execute
  } else if (i %% 5 == 0) {
    print("Divisible by 5")
  } else {
    print(i)
  }
}
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

```{python}
for i in range(1, 20):
  if i%15 == 0:
    print("Exiting now")
    break
  elif i%3 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 3")
    continue
    print("After the next statement") # this should never execute
  elif i%5 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 5")
  else: 
    print(i)

```

To be quite honest, I haven't really ever needed to use next/continue statements when I'm programming, and I rarely use break statements. However, it's useful to know they exist just in case you come across a problem where you could put either one to use.


## Recursion {#sec-recursion}

Under construction. 

In the meantime, check out @datamentorRecursion2017 (R) and @parewalabspvtPythonRecursion2020 (Python) for decent coverage of the basic idea of recursive functions.
