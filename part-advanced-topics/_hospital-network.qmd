::: Demo: Hierarchical Hospital Data

There are many different entities in a hospital: doctors, nurses, lab techs, janitors, patients, and equipment.
Imagine we have a general database for storing hospital records.
There are many different types of records we might find in a hospital:

- employment contracts
- supervisory relationships
- payroll records
- individual paychecks
- lists of doctors, nurses, and technicians
- available equipment
- equipment maintenance and repair records
- types of lab tests available
- patient information
- insurance records
- visit records
- records from individual lab tests

Each employee would have associated records such as an employment contract, background check, paychecks, and so on.
Employees would be linked together in an organizational chart, with links between an employee and their supervisor(s) up the chain of command.
The hospital might also want to have lists of employees who are doctors, nurses, and lab techs, so that they can validate that lab techs are not assigned as doctors or nurses (or vice versa).

Patients would have associated records too: insurance, visits, bills, test results, and so on.
For each visit record, there would be a single patient, but potentially multiple nurses and doctors.
Lab results would link to the individual who ordered the test, the individual performing the test, and possibly the individual releasing the report (though this has been omitted for simplicity), but results would also need to link the type of test performed and the equipment used (if applicable).
This type of hierarchical data gets very complicated, very quickly!

      This diagram contains entities such as employees, supervisors, hr_contracts, doctor, nurse, technician, paycheck, patient, visit, test, equipment, result, and insurance.
      Relationships between e.g. employees and supervisors are described with annotated lines - each employee has one supervisor, while each supervisor has many employees.
      Each paycheck corresponds to a single employee, but an employee should have multiple paychecks.
      Doctors, Nurses, and Technicians are each subsets of the employees list, and so on.
      Each entity has one or more fields, and some fields are primary keys (they uniquely identify a single entity record) while others are foreign keys, which can be used to identify links to related entity records.
