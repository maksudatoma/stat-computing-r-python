I get what you mean but I don't think that there's such a clear correlation between people talking about someone and their success. Sure he probably got thousands of dollars of views from random curious people, but in the wider context of a multi million $ channel that needs to worry about its future and reputation, that's a drop.

The whole incident actually negatively impacted his subscriber growth, I'm sure brands/other creators are going to be less likely to work with him, and it probably hurt his relationship with the audience that buys his stuff. To have dozens of huge celebrities like aaron paul and sophie turner call you out is probably quite damaging, especially as he said before that he has ambitions to be in lots of industries (film, etc).   

Also in general, it doesn't sit well with me that we shouldn't talk about things just because of the way the system is set up to reward people. Even if there exists a group of people who are attracted to supporting things that we criticise, we should keep doing what we want and saying what we think. Otherwise we're letting morons dictate what we do.

Ideally from this situation he would take a hit to his reputation significant enough to change and discourage other people from doing dumb things. I think philip defranco tweeted that his audience was fine with the vlog, it had like 500k likes 'uncontested', so that pressure is not going to come from his own audience, but from outside people. Those outside people being celebrities, newspapers, normal commenters, etc. And honestly by now I think he's been in the press enough that most internet-dwelling people have heard of him, so his aim is probably to have a better image with people rather than finding new people. 

That all sounds like my dumb comic was a carefully calculated move to help dismantle the Paul empire lol. He did a dumb thing, I made a comic, that's about it, but it is interesting to talk about

(and a question in the comments..),"Edit: Heck I've just reread your comment and it says based off a prompt, my bad. That does work much better, but if someone describes a difficult situation, or something I don't normally paint, then I might struggle a bit. But I do like that it could be posted to the patreon or elsewhere if it has broader appeal. 

hey I'm hesitating a bit about the prospect of doing commissions on there. They would take an hour or two each to do, and generally it's a bit of a hassle. Mostly because I will be the first to say that I'm not technically brilliant at painting, and so peoples' pictures don't always align with what I am capable of painting, or the style I use. When it comes to illustrating reddit comments or making comics, I have a lot of freedom to make sure things look alright, but if I have to copy a photo then it becomes noticeably uncomfortable. Most notably, my typical character in an illustration has a roughly 1.5 inch face comprising of a few circles; so you can imagine how unappealing a head and shoulders portrait looks on paper unless I change the style. 

Each commission could be taking up a good chunk of a day painting, and then some more with revisions, and ideally I want to be spending as much time illustrating things that everyone can appreciate.

I'm not sure if that's introversion or not, but it's when that gap between *what I want to be able to do* and *what I am able to do* is publicly highlighted that I would get uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an exceptionally uninformed opinion because I lack experience in, and the braincells for, this game, but I saw the post about making the houses need things to be delivered directly. Maybe I am wrong but I got the impression there was lots of feedback from people who have mastered the game quite thoroughly and were concerned with their more complicated creations. We should not rule out that I am a complete moron, but I played 2-3 hours into my first game and got to a point where I was happily making X in once place and Y in another, for distinct purposes, but then the time came where X needed to get to Y and I thought heck and nearly gave up lol. I think building a market and chuting a farm into it was my first little satisfying victory of automation which was rewarding. In my opinion, requiring relatively spaghetti chutes and planning from the start would have been too much too quickly for me. Honestly I still don't know how I'd do it nicely. But forgive me for reiterating; I may just be weak-willed and dim, beyond the average player you want to appeal to.",4,4,0,0

Maybe I'm being dramatic but his drawings are like nothing else anyone has ever made and I could go on for hours about that (much to the annoyance of my friends). My favourite account of drawing is that it is a record of a feeling, and his drawings do that perfectly. I have read and watched everything there is about him I can find, and look at his pictures every day. I'm sitting underneath some of his posters now, my brushes sit in one of his mugs and I drink my tea from another, and I'm going to see another of his exhibitions next week
