These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data you have. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing informative data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Visual analysis appears to be functionally divided between an early preattentive level of processing at which simple features are coded spatially in parallel and a later stage at which focused attention is required to conjoin the separate features into coherent objects. Evidence supporting this dichotomy comes from behavioral studies of visual search, from differences in the ease of texture segregation, from reports of illusory conjunctions when attention is overloaded, from subjects' ability to identify simple features correctly even when they mislocate them, and from the substantial benefit of pre-cuing the location of a relevant item when the task requires that features be conjoined but not when simple features are sufficient. Some further studies of search have revealed a striking asymmetry between several pairs of stimuli which differ in the presence or absence of a single part or property. The asymmetry depends solely on which of the pair is allocated the role of target and which is replicated to form the background items. It suggests that search for the presence of a visual primitive is automatic and parallel, whereas search for the absence of the same feature is serial and requires focused attention. The search asymmetry can be used as an additional diagnostic to help define the functional features extracted by the visual system.},

  abstract = {Color blindness or color vision deficiency (CVD) is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color. It can impair tasks such as selecting ripe fruit, choosing clothing, and reading traffic lights. Color blindness may make some academic activities more difficult. However, issues are generally minor, and the colorblind automatically develop adaptations and coping mechanisms. People with total color blindness (achromatopsia) may also be uncomfortable in bright environments and have decreased visual acuity. The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited problem or variation in the functionality of one or more of the three classes of cone cells in the retina, which mediate color vision. The most common form is caused by a genetic disorder called congenital red\textendash green color blindness. Males are more likely to be color blind than females, because the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome. Non-color-blind females can carry genes for color blindness and pass them on to their children. Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye, the optic nerve, or parts of the brain. Screening for color blindness is typically done with the Ishihara color test.There is no cure for color blindness. Diagnosis may allow an individual, or their parents/teachers to actively accommodate the condition. Special lenses such as EnChroma glasses or X-chrom contact lenses may help people with red\textendash green color blindness at some color tasks, but they do not grant the wearer "normal color vision". Mobile apps can help people identify colors.Red\textendash green color blindness is the most common form, followed by blue\textendash yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red\textendash green color blindness affects up to 1 in 12 males (8\%) and 1 in 200 females (0.5\%). The ability to see color also decreases in old age. In certain countries, color blindness may make people ineligible for certain jobs, such as those of aircraft pilots, train drivers, crane operators, and people in the armed forces. The effect of color blindness on artistic ability is controversial, but a number of famous artists are believed to have been color blind.},
