C, Pascal, Fortran, and UNIX shells are naturally procedural. JavaScript is also a fairly natural procedural language. Many R analysis scripts are also naturally written in a procedural style; SAS code is almost always procedural.\n- **Declarative languages** use code to describe the problem that needs to be solved, and the language figures out how to solve it. SQL is the most common declarative language you'll encounter for data-related tasks.\n- **Object oriented** languages (sometimes abbreviated OOP, for object-oriented programming) manipulate collections of objects or classes. Data is stored in classes that have associated functions, which are often called methods. Java is explicitly object-oriented; C++ and Python support object-oriented programming but don't force you to use those features.\n- **Functional** programming languages describe a problem using a set of functions, which only take inputs and produce outputs. Functions don't have any internal tracking of **state** - purely functional languages move from input to output without storing variables or even printing output to the command line, but it is common to adopt a functional approach to programming without requiring strict adherence to all principles of a fully functional approach. Haskell and Rust are fairly standard functional programming languages.\n\n\n::: {.youtube-video-container .aside}\nHadley's talk on The Joy of Functional Programming for Data Science\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzUmK0Y07ck\" title=\"&quot;The Joy of Functional Programming (for Data Science)&quot; with Hadley Wickham\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n:::\n\n\nFunctional programming languages have a goal of writing **pure functions** - functions that do not change the global state (stuff stored in objects, memory, parameters, or files) of the program and thus have no side effects. \nThe return value of a pure function is based solely on the inputs to the function.\nNot all functions can be pure functions - for instance, there's no pure way to do file IO operations. \nBut it is a nice goal to be able to move parameters into functions and have the correct object returned from that function, so that you can pipe multiple operations together into a pipeline.\n\nMost general-purpose languages like C++ and Python and even some domain languages like R support multiple different programming paradigms. \nWhile preparing to write this chapter, I saw functional programming books with examples in Java [@urmaModernJavaAction2018], JavaScript [@FPJS], and C# [@buonannoFunctionalProgrammingHow2017] - all languages that I would associate with OOP or procedural styles.\nI also found books teaching object oriented programming using Fortran 90-95 [@OOPfortran], which is something I wouldn't have considered possible.\n\nAll of this is to say that while certain languages are built around principles like OOP or functional programming, almost every language has users who rely more heavily on one approach than the other. \nThere are very few \"pure\" programming languages, which reminds me of one of my favorite quotes about English: \n\n> \"The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.\" ― [James D. Nicoll](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/694108-the-problem-with-defending-the-purity-of-the-english-language)\n\n::: callout-demo\n### Object Oriented Philosophy in R and Python\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Python\n\nWhen you call `df.size()` in Python, you are calling the `size` method that is part of the `df` object, which is a `DataFrame`. \nThis suggests that Pandas, at least, is programmed using an object-oriented paradigm. \n\n#### R\n\n<!-- R is a bit of a trickier case.  -->\n<!-- R has several different types of object-oriented structures that we usually avoid talking about until you start looking at developing your own R packages.  -->\n<!-- R also was designed by people who enjoyed using Lisp - another multi-paradigm approach that accommodates functional programming, procedural programming, and object-oriented programming.  -->\nAn easy example of R's object oriented nature is that when you fit different models or perform different tests, the default output is different. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(mtcars)\n\nr1 <- t.test(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$vs)\nprint(r1)\n## \n## \tWelch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  mtcars$mpg by mtcars$vs\n## t = -4.6671, df = 22.716, p-value = 0.0001098\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -11.462508  -4.418445\n## sample estimates:\n## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n##        16.61667        24.55714\n\nr2 <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$vs)\nprint(r2)\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$vs)\n## \n## Coefficients:\n## (Intercept)    mtcars$vs  \n##       16.62         7.94\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output is different because each test/regression model object has a different print method, which allows R to create different output for each type of object. \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFunctional programming allows us to write programs that are more modular, and thus, are easier to test and debug.\nIn addition, functional programming encourages you to think about data **pipelines**: a sequence of steps that are reproducible and reusable for different data sets and analyses.\nFunctional programming is convenient for another (more esoteric, but important) reason - it allows you to prove that a function or series of functions is actually correct (rather than just testing input/output combinations). \n\n![A pipeline of functional data analysis. Each function (station) modifies the data in some way and the returned result is passed into the next function (station) as input. This allows a sequence of functions to format data, visualize it, model it, and then package the results. While this paradigm doesn't require a functional approach, functional programming does make it simpler. Modified from [Allison Horst's work](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)](../images/wrangling/functional-pipeline.png){fig-alt=\"Cute fuzzy monsters putting rectangular data tables onto a conveyor belt. Along the conveyor belt line are different automated “stations” that update the data. A monster at the end of the conveyor belt is carrying away a table that reads “Complete analysis.”\"}\n\nIf you have been using the R pipe (`|>` or `%>%`), you didn't realize it, but you were already using functional programming. Piping results from one function to another in a chain is a prime example of the \"pure function\" idea - it allows us to chain each step of a sequence together to create a sequence that is modular and testable.\n\n::: callout-demo\n\n### A simple Functional Example\n\nA **functional** is a function that takes another function as input and returns a vector as output.\n\nOne simple example of a functional that is found in both R and Python is the `apply` function (or variants in R like `lapply`, `sapply`, `tapply`). \nIn Python, `.apply` is a method in Pandas, but we can find an even more low-level equivalent in the ideas of **list comprehensions** and **map** functions. \n\nOne additional concept that is helpful before we start is the idea of a **lambda** function - a small anonymous function (that is, a function that is not  named or stored in a variable).\nLambda functions are great for filling in default arguments, but they have many other uses as well.\n\nCan you identify the lambda functions in each of the following examples?\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R\n\nThis code generates 5 draws from a normal random variable with the specified mean and standard deviation 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(1:5, function(x) rnorm(5, mean = x, sd = 1))\n## [[1]]\n## [1]  0.5444854  1.1913062  0.1553164  1.4158201 -0.8077051\n## \n## [[2]]\n## [1] 1.754268 3.250417 2.997849 2.254243 2.318008\n## \n## [[3]]\n## [1] 2.767032 3.964320 3.050573 2.217316 2.573504\n## \n## [[4]]\n## [1] 4.548238 3.949400 3.432451 4.194624 2.703440\n## \n## [[5]]\n## [1] 5.821165 5.246779 5.429908 5.580527 6.032268\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr, if you have R 4.1.0 or above, you can use a shorthand version:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlapply(1:5, \\(x) rnorm(5, mean = x))\n## [[1]]\n## [1] -0.29660888  0.35035458  1.15644411  1.43096670  0.02332596\n## \n## [[2]]\n## [1]  2.91492614  2.06957942  1.87203646  1.08135345 -0.04508632\n## \n## [[3]]\n## [1] 3.817065 3.537327 2.078230 2.322051 2.395170\n## \n## [[4]]\n## [1] 3.715454 3.106401 3.247968 4.507553 5.487187\n## \n## [[5]]\n## [1] 6.537689 6.603674 4.669902 5.283484 6.177524\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `\\(x)` is shorthand for `function(x)` and allows you to quickly and easily define anonymous functions in R.\n\n\n#### Python\n\nThis code generates 5 draws from a normal random variable with the specified mean and standard deviation 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n\n# List comprehension approach\nr1 = [np.random.normal(i, size = 5) for i in range(1, 6)]\nprint(r1) \n\n# Functional approach\n# Defining a lambda function allows us to fill in non-default options\n## [array([0.68389785, 0.2501753 , 0.49416271, 0.61469877, 1.40231046]), array([1.41761066, 2.70778303, 2.1995427 , 2.42044613, 3.27899181]), array([6.87065308, 2.53907281, 0.61080063, 2.38524358, 2.51033995]), array([3.10651983, 5.72328591, 4.20824499, 3.71375811, 3.42833177]), array([3.75871545, 5.64904145, 5.5778744 , 3.69353482, 4.6528069 ])]\nr2 = map(lambda a: np.random.normal(a, size = 5), range(1, 6))\n\n# This is what map spits out by default\nprint(r2)\n# get your results back out with list()\n## <map object at 0x7f88cf0fbd60>\nr2b = list(r2) \nprint(r2b)\n## [array([-0.84527474,  2.1499981 ,  1.60810808, -0.75843562,  1.01398618]), array([3.61860093, 2.14597027, 2.62869296, 2.97544145, 1.84368563]), array([4.11932686, 4.72430774, 4.3942944 , 2.43962921, 4.6299628 ]), array([3.91880835, 4.70198951, 3.15930327, 4.96334742, 5.27347438]), array([4.70255964, 4.79526801, 5.88232157, 6.31126409, 4.15595822])]\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Replacing Loops with Functional Programming\n\nOne really convenient application of functional programming is to replace loops. \nAs Hadley Wickham says in [-@advr], \n\n> the real downside of for loops is that they’re very flexible: a loop conveys that you’re iterating, but not what should be done with the results\n\nThat is, in many cases when programming with data, what we want is to iterate over a vector and return a vector of results. \nThis is a *perfect* use case for functional programming, since we're specifying both that we're iterating AND more explicitly collecting the results into a form that makes sense.\n\nIf we work with this definition of functional programming, then python list comprehensions are also a functional approach: they specify how the results are collected (usually by putting `[]` around the statement) and how the iteration will occur @rituraj_jainNestedListComprehensions2018.\n\n::: aside\nThere is an excellent vignette comparing Base R functional programming approaches to the `purrr` package that is worth a look if you've used one and want to try the other [@hadleywickhamPurrrBase2022].\n:::\n\nLet's look at a few examples.\n\n::: callout-demo\nSuppose we want to look at the Lego data and create a decade variable that describes the decade a set was first released.\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### base R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlego <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/datasets/main/clean/lego_sets.csv\")\n\nlego$decade <- sapply(lego$year, \\(x) floor(x/10)*10)\nhead(lego[,c(\"set_num\", \"name\", \"year\", \"decade\")])\n##   set_num                       name year decade\n## 1   001-1                      Gears 1965   1960\n## 2  0011-2          Town Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 3  0011-3 Castle 2 for 1 Bonus Offer 1987   1980\n## 4  0012-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 5  0013-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n## 6  0014-1         Space Mini-Figures 1979   1970\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, this use of `sapply` isn't necessary - because R is vectorized by default, we could also have used `lego$decade <- floor(lego$year/10)*10`.\nHowever, there are functions in R that are not fully vectorized, and it is useful to know this approach for those use-cases as well, and it's easier to demonstrate this approach with a relatively simple use case.\n\n### R: `purrr`\n\nIn purrr, you can create anonymous functions using `~` with `.` as a placeholder.

We \"unnest\" the summary information, which is equivalent to bringing the columns we defined up to the primary level and binding the rows together.\n\nAt each step, we're specifying the form of the results along with the contents.\n\n\n#### Python\n\nThis construct of storing everything inside a single data frame isn't as common in Python, but we can make it work with only a little extra effort. \n\nYou will need to `pip install statsmodels` to get the `statsmodels` [@seabold2010statsmodels] package that implements many basic statistical models. \nThe `scikit-learn` package [@scikitlearn] is another commonly used package [@menonLinearRegressionLines2018], but it does not have the easy accessor functions to pull out e.g. coefficients and r-squared values, so we'll use `statsmodels` here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n\n# Create a function to fit a linear regression\n# There is probably a better way to do this flexibly,\n# but this approach is simple and useful for illustrative purposes\ndef pokereg(data):\n  x = data[[\"hp\"]].values\n  y = data[[\"total\"]].values\n  model = ols('total ~ hp', data)\n  results = model.fit()\n  return results\n\nres = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/datasets/main/clean/pokemon_gen_1-9.csv\")\n\n# Replace NAs with \"\"\nres[\"variant\"] = [\"\" if pd.isna(i) else i for i in res.variant]\n# Remove mega pokemon\nres = res.query('~(variant.str.contains(\"(?:^[mM]ega)\"))')\n\n# Group data frames and apply regression function to each group\nres_reg = (\n  res # step 1\n    .groupby(\"gen\") # step 2\n    .apply(pokereg) # step 3\n)\n\n# Make results into a dataframe and rename the column as 'results'\nres_reg = pd.DataFrame(res_reg).rename(columns = {0:'results'}) # step 4\n\n# Get values of interest and store in new columns # step 5\nres_reg = res_reg.reset_index() # store gen in its own column\nres_reg['coef1'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.params[0])\nres_reg['coef2'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.params[1])\nres_reg['rsq'] = res_reg.results.map(lambda x: x.rsquared)\n\nres_reg[['gen', 'coef1', 'coef2', 'rsq']]\n##    gen       coef1     coef2       rsq\n## 0    1  262.472956  2.394032  0.389526\n## 1    2  258.581538  2.133868  0.316529\n## 2    3  245.337496  2.753912  0.268681\n## 3    4  268.579237  2.792350  0.350019\n## 4    5  189.133898  3.506458  0.557880\n## 5    6  252.743437  2.798942  0.527816\n## 6    7  234.932868  3.293730  0.438289\n## 7    8  205.272637  3.500811  0.604222\n## 8    9  236.865627  2.757408  0.475703\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile this doesn't store our data in the same DataFrame as the model results, we do have a key that links the two: the `gen` variable is present in both `res` and `res_reg` and can be used to join the data to the regression results, if necessary.\n\n1. Data in an ungrouped data frame\n2. We group by `gen` (generation)\n3. We apply the function `pokereg` to fit a linear regression, and the results are stored in an indexed Series where the index corresponds to `gen`.\n4. We make the results into a DataFrame so that we can add extra columns, and rename the automatically created Series to `results` to be more descriptive\n5. We create summary information and store the summaries in columns in the data frame.\n\nWhile the grouping and binding operations are in a different order in Python than in R, the basic specification of the structure of the output each time we iterate is similar.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.youtube-video-container .aside}\nHere's another demonstration of the use of the `tidymodels` package and `purrr` to fit multiple regression models to data subsets.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KdDyRt9XV_g\" title=\"Nested data frames and multiple models in R

Structures\n\nNot all datasets are strictly tabular. \nOne of the most common situations where we get data that can't be made into a completely tabular structure is when we're dealing with hierarchical data: tree structures, (network) graph structures, and even most webpages contain data that isn't strictly tabular in nature.\nSometimes, we can get that data into a tabular structure, but it generally depends on the data itself.\n\nOne of the most common structures for storing data on the web is [JSON: JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)[@wikipediacontributorsJSON2023]. \n\n::: aside\n(JSON is pronounced \"Jason\", like the person's name).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n![The Movie Database](../images/wrangling/tmdb.svg){fig-alt=\"The Movie Database logo\"}\nIn this section we'll work with some data gathered from TMDB (the movie database). \nI submitted a query for all movies

On recommendation from his son, Sav, Dad hires two of Sav's unemployed school friends, Bob and Vic, to help with the business and the crime. After some careless talk from Harold, just known as 'H', about Dad's pension fund, Vic and Bob decide to steal the money from Dad if they can find it. The plans to liberate the money go awry and Sav is killed requiring Bob to call upon his sister Chris to rescue them. Dad intercepts their escape and forces a showdown to try to determine exactly the events of the night in order to identify his son's killer.\n## 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Shaw turned to the classic Victorian melodrama to focus on the insincerity of much that his audience held dear, especially family and marriage.

Life, if it had started at all, would be in its earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane force and there would be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling that of Venus.  Around 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planet called Theia hit the newly formed Proto-Earth. The blast sent planetary material from the pair into orbit around earth which eventually formed the Moon.  In this one-hour special, viewers learn what Earth was like before the moon creating impact, and what Earth would have been like if the moon had never existed.\n## 19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Renowned Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart features as the eponymous anti-hero in this Soviet-era adaptation of one of Shakespeare's darkest and most powerful tragedies.\n## 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The gripping true-life story of the legendary 1925 \"Serum Run,\" in which 34 men and more than 150 dogs, rushed life-saving anti-toxin across the frozen arctic to save the children of Nome, AK from a deadly outbreak of diphtheria.\n## 21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Epithet: a short film starring Patrick Stewart.

During the repressive 1950's, Dr. Evelyn Hooker undertook ground breaking research that led to a radical discovery: homosexuals were not, by definition, \"sick.\" Dr. Hooker's finding sent shock waves through the psychiatric community and culminated in a major victory for gay rights - in 1974 the weight of her studies, along with gay activism, forced the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its official manual of mental disorders. Startling archival footage of the medical procedure used to \"cure\" homosexuality, images from the underground gay world of the McCarthy era and home movies of literary icon Christopher Isherwood bring to life history which we must never forget.

From bloodthirsty beasts to murderous pirates and a mad genius named Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart), treachery lurks behind every corner on this island, and if these five survivors have any hope of staying alive, they'll have to fight to their dying breaths to escape the island and get back to the modern world.\n## 94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Mozart's death is surrounded by mystery. 200 years later, an inquest examines the original and new evidence.\n## 95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               A space shuttle mission investigating Halley's Comet brings back a malevolent race of space vampires who transform most of London's population into zombies.

He imagined himself to be Lord Byron, a bigamist, and a prize-fighter; but the poems of his madness are perhaps the most remarkable he ever wrote.  \"Clare's asylum foretells our need for an asylum, his deprivation foretells our deprivation\" (Geoffrey Grigson)  Commentary spoken by Tony Church  (from BBC Midlands)  (David Jones and Patrick Stewart are members of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Tony Church appears by permission of the Northcott Theatre, Exeter)\n## 128                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Former Irish Republican Army member Niall Hennessy lives in Belfast, Ireland, with his wife and daughter amid the ongoing Irish-British conflict.

not at all happy. Especially as there's a ghost and a mysterious re-appearing bloodstain on the hearth. She campaigns to go back home, and her dad, believing the ghost's pranks are Ginny's, is ready to send her back. But then Ginny actually meets the elusive 17th-century Sir Simon de Canterville (not to mention the cute teenaged duke next door), and she sets her hand to the task of freeing Sir Simon from his curse.\n## 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In this re-imagining of Shakespear's King Lear, Patrick Stewart stars as John Lear, a Texas cattle baron, who, after dividing his wealth among his three daughters, is rejected by them.\n## 5 King Henry II (Patrick Stewart) keeps his wife, Eleanor (Glenn Close) locked away in the towers because of her frequent attempts to overthrow him. With Eleanor out of the way he can have his dalliances with his young mistress (Yuliya Vysotskaya). Needless to say the queen is not pleased, although she still has affection for the king. Working through her sons, she plots the king's demise and the rise of her second and preferred son, Richard (Andrew Howard), to the throne. The youngest son, John (Rafe Spall), an overweight buffoon and the only son holding his father's affection is the king's choice after the death of his first son, young Henry. But John is also overly eager for power and is willing to plot his father's demise with middle brother, Geoffrey (John Light) and the young king of France, Phillip (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Geoffrey, of course sees his younger brother's weakness and sees that route as his path to power. Obviously political and court intrigue ensues\n## 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Scrooge is a miserly old businessman in 1840s London.

Life, if it had started at all, would be in its earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane force and there would be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling that of Venus.  Around 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planet called Theia hit the newly formed Proto-Earth. The blast sent planetary material from the pair into orbit around earth which eventually formed the Moon.

During the repressive 1950's, Dr. Evelyn Hooker undertook ground breaking research that led to a radical discovery: homosexuals were not, by definition, \"sick.\" Dr. Hooker's finding sent shock waves through the psychiatric community and culminated in a major victory for gay rights - in 1974 the weight of her studies, along with gay activism, forced the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its official manual of mental disorders. Startling archival footage of the medical procedure used to \"cure\" homosexuality, images from the underground gay world of the McCarthy era and home movies of literary icon Christopher Isherwood bring to life history which we must never forget.

Self-described as the toughest film he ever made, Excalibur told the tale of King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone and helped start the careers of actors Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren and Patrick Stewart.

biography by David Jones  with Freddie Jones as John Clare \"I am - yet what I am, none cares or knows\" (John Clare)  John Clare (1792-1864), farm labourer, had three obsessions: his youthful love for Mary Joyce, the countryside of his native Northamptonshire, and the need to celebrate both in his poetry.  Clare cracked under the increasing strain of poverty and neglect, and spent the last 23 years of his life in Northampton General Lunatic Asylum.

Our top-level structure is a list with 3 values: cast, crew, and id. So let's see if we can read things in as a series instead of a DataFrame first, and hopefully we can use that to get some traction on the situation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npatrick_stewart = pd.read_json(data_url, typ='series', orient = 'records')\n\n# First item in the cast list\npatrick_stewart.cast[0]\n## {'adult': False, 'backdrop_path': '/mNdsbVuRdsyo8eitW2IBW2BWRkU.jpg', 'genre_ids': [878, 28, 12, 53], 'id': 193, 'original_language': 'en', 'original_title': 'Star Trek: Generations', 'overview': \"Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Soran who is destroying entire star systems.
