functions are a concise way of performing an action.\n\n## {{< fa bullseye >}} Objectives\n\n-   Understand how functions are used in R and python\n-   Understand how to install packages in R and python\n-   Understand how to load packages in R and python\n-   Use pipes to restructure code so that it is more readable\n\n## Mathematical Operators\n\nLet's first start with a special class of functions that you're probably familiar with from your math classes - mathematical operators.\n\nHere are a few of the most important ones:\n\n| Operation        | R symbol | Python symbol |\n|------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Addition         | `+`      | `+`           |\n| Subtraction      | `-`      | `-`           |\n| Multiplication   | `*`      | `*`           |\n| Division         | `/`      | `/`           |\n| Integer Division | `%/%`    | `//`          |\n| Modular Division | `%%`     | `%`           |\n| Exponentiation   | `^`      | `**`          |\n\nThese operands are all for scalar operations (operations on a single number) - vectorized versions, such as matrix multiplication, are somewhat more complicated (and different between R and python).\n\n::: callout-caution\n### Example: Integer and Modular Division\n\nInteger division is the whole number answer to A/B, and modular division is the fractional remainder when A/B.\n\nLet's demonstrate with the problem 14/3, which evaluates to 4.6666667 when division is used, but has integer part 4 and remainder 2.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### R {.unnumbered}\n\n`14 %/% 3` in R would be 4, and `14 %% 3` in R would be 2.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n14 %/% 3\n## [1] 4\n14 %% 3\n## [1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n14 // 3\n## 4\n14 % 3\n## 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Order of Operations\n\nBoth R and Python operate under the same mathematical rules of precedence that you learned in school.\nYou may have learned the acronym PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, and Addition/Subtraction.\nThat is, when examining a set of mathematical operations, we evaluate parentheses first, then exponents, and then we do multiplication/division, and finally, we add and subtract.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(1+1)^(5-2) \n## [1] 8\n1 + 2^3 * 4 \n## [1] 33\n3*1^3 \n## [1] 3\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n(1+1)**(5-2)\n## 8\n1 + 2**3*4\n## 33\n3*1**3\n## 3\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Simple String Operations\n\nPython has some additional operators that work on strings.\nIn R, you will have to use functions to perform these operations, as R does not have string operators.\n\n::: callout-demo\n::: panel-tabset\n### Python {.unnumbered}\n\nIn Python, `+` will **concatenate** (stick together) two strings.\nMultiplying a string by an integer will repeat the string the specified number of times.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n\"first \" + \"second\"\n## 'first second'\n\"hello \" * 3\n## 'hello hello hello '\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### R {.unnumbered}\n\nIn R, to concatenate things, we need to use functions: `paste` or `paste0`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste(\"first\", \"second\", sep = \" \")\n## [1] \"first second\"\npaste(\"first\", \"second\", collapse = \" \")\n## [1] \"first second\"\npaste(c(\"first\", \"second\"), sep = \" \") # sep only works w/ 2 objects passed in\n## [1] \"first\"  \"second\"\npaste(c(\"first\", \"second\"), collapse = \" \") # collapse works on vectors\n## [1] \"first second\"\n\npaste(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"), \n      c(\"first\", \"second\", \"third\", \"fourth\"), \n      sep = \"-\", collapse = \" \")\n## [1] \"a-first b-second c-third d-fourth\"\n# sep is used to collapse parameters, then collapse is used to collapse vectors\n\npaste0(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n## [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\npaste0(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") # equivalent to paste(..., sep = \"\")\n## [1] \"abc\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou don't need to understand the details of this code at this point in the class, but it is useful to know how to combine strings in both languages.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Using Functions\n\n**Functions** are sets of instructions that take **arguments** and **return** values.\nStrictly speaking, mathematical operators (like those above) are a special type of functions -- but we aren't going to get into that now.\n\nWe're also not going to talk about how to create our own functions just yet.\nInstead, I'm going to show you how to *use* functions.\n\n::: callout-warning\n### Cheat Sheets!\n\nIt may be helpful at this point to print out the [R reference card](../files/Short-refcard.pdf)[^02-prog-functions-1] and the [Python reference card](../files/Python3_reference_cheat_sheet.pdf)[^02-prog-functions-2]\n.

it can be hard to make sure you're using the right environment.\nIt doesn't help that there are several different environment management systems in python - `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, and `conda` are the main options.\n\n#### Python environments\n\n`conda` and `virtualenv` (`venv`) are both virtual environment management systems. `conda` is sometimes preferred for scientific computing because it handles the complex dependencies that arise from large packages like `numpy` and `scipi` and `pandas` a bit better than `pip` does alone.\n\nThis guide assumes you have `conda` set up already.\nBy default, @sec-setting-up just installs python at the system level.\nIf you want to use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) you should go read the documentation for those installers and follow those steps first.\nAlternately, you can install and load the `reticulate` R package and then run `install_miniconda()` - this will install `miniconda` somewhere that RStudio can find it, but it may make using `miniconda` outside of RStudio difficult.\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=true}\n###### Consistency is critical\n\nI *highly* recommend that you pick one of these options and use that consistently, rather than trying the advantages and disadvantages of each option in different projects.\nHere is a webcomic to serve as a cautionary tale if you do not heed this warning.\n\n[![Python Environment, by Randall Munroe of \\[xkcd\\](https://xkcd.com/1987/).

Make sure your virtual environment/conda environment is activated (if applicable)\n2. Installation commands:\n    - If you are using system or venv, `pip3 install <package name>` should install your package. \n    - If you are using conda, `conda install <package name>` is preferable, and if that doesn't work, then try using `pip3 install <package name>`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n# If you're using virtualenv\npip install <pkg1>\n\n# If you're using conda, try this first\nconda install <pkg1>\n# If that fails, try pip\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n##### RStudio\nNote: This does NOT work for system package installation.\n\n1. Make sure R is using the correct python installation\n2. In the R terminal, run `reticulate::py_install(\"package name\")`\n\n##### Python Chunk Magic\nThis is less elegant, but nearly foolproof as long as RStudio knows where to find python.\n\n1. At the top of the chunk, write `%pip install <package name>`\n2.

If your package is not on CRAN, and is instead on e.g. GitHub, you may have to use the `remotes` package to install it with `remotes::install_github(\"user/repo\")`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# CRAN packages\ninstall.packages(\"<pkg1>\")\n\n# Github packages\nremotes::install_github(\"username/reponame\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Loading Packages\n\nOnce you have the package installed, you need to load the package into memory so that you can use the functions and data contained within.\nAgain, R and python differ slightly in how programmers conventionally handle this process.\n\n-   R: Load all of the package's functions, overwriting already loaded functions if necessary\n-   Python: Load all of the package's functions, contained within an object that is either the package name or a shortened alias.\n\nNow, both R and python can load packages in either way, so this isn't an either/or thing - it's about knowing what the conventions of the language are, and then deciding whether or not it is appropriate to follow those conventions in your project.\n\n::: callout-demo\n#### Import the whole package and all functions\n\nTo demonstrate this approach, let's create a simple plot with a plotting library (`ggplot2` in R, `plotnine` in Python).\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### R\n\nAll of the other packages in this plot are present by default in any new R environment.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# This code lists all the functions available to be called\npkgs <- search()\npkgs <- pkgs[grep(\"package:\",pkgs)]\n# get all the functions in each package that is loaded\nall_fns <- lapply(pkgs, function(x) as.character(lsf.str(x)))\n# create a data frame\npkg_fns <- data.frame(pkg = rep(pkgs, sapply(all_fns, length)), \n                      fn = unlist(all_fns))\npkg_fns$pkg <- gsub(\"package:\", \"\", pkg_fns$pkg)\n\n\nggplot(pkg_fns, aes(x = pkg, y = after_stat(count), fill = pkg)) + \n  geom_bar() + theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  ylab(\"# Functions\") + xlab(\"Package\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02-prog-functions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n##### Python\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfrom plotnine import *\n## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotnine'\n\n# I have no clue how to get all callable objects in python \n# classes and methods for those classes make this a lot harder... ugh\n\npkg_fns = r.pkg_fns # This is just the same data from R\n\n(\n  ggplot(pkg_fns, aes(x = \"pkg\", fill = \"pkg\")) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(\"count\"))) + \n  theme(legend_position = \"none\") + \n  ylab(\"# Functions\") + xlab(\"Package\")\n)\n## NameError: name 'ggplot' is not defined\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: callout-demo\n#### Use functions from the package without loading everything\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### R\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This code lists all the functions available to be called\npkgs <- search()\npkgs <- pkgs[grep(\"package:\",pkgs)]\n# get all the functions in each package that is loaded\nall_fns <- lapply(pkgs, function(x) as.character(lsf.str(x)))\n# create a data frame\npkg_fns <- data.frame(pkg = rep(pkgs, sapply(all_fns, length)), \n                      fn = unlist(all_fns))\npkg_fns$pkg <- gsub(\"package:\", \"\", pkg_fns$pkg)\n\nggplot2::ggplot(pkg_fns, ggplot2::aes(x = pkg, fill = pkg)) + \n  ggplot2::geom_bar(y = ggplot2::after_stat(count)) + \n  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  ggplot2::xlab(\"Package\") + ggplot2::ylab(\"# Functions\")\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'count' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n##### Python\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport plotnine as p9\n## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotnine'\npkg_fns = r.pkg_fns\n\n(\n  p9.ggplot(pkg_fns, p9.aes(x = \"pkg\", fill = \"pkg\")) + \n  p9.geom_bar(y = p9.after_stat(\"count\")) + \n  p9.theme(legend_position = \"none\") + \n  p9.xlab(\"Package\") + p9.ylab(\"# Functions\")\n)\n## NameError: name 'p9' is not defined\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIn python, you can use `import package as nickname`, or you can just use `import package` and reference the package name directly.\nThere are some packages which have typical aliases, and it's best to use those so that you can look things up and not get too confused.\n\n| Package             | Common Alias | Explanation                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| pandas              | pd           | shorter                                                                                        |\n| numpy               | np           | shorter                                                                                        |\n| seaborn             | sns          | This is a reference to Samuel Norman Seaborn, played by Rob Lowe, in the TV show The West Wing |\n| plotnine            | p9           |                                                                                                |\n| BeautifulSoup (bs4) | bs           | BeautifulSoup is a reference to Alice in Wonderland.
