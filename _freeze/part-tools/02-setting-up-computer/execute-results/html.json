Download and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN:\n\n    -   {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>\n    -   {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/>\n    -   {{< fa brands linux >}} Linux: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/> (pick your distribution)\n\n    If you are on {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows, you should also install the [Rtools4 package](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/); this will ensure you get fewer warnings later when installing packages.\n    \n    If you are on {{< fa brands apple >}} Mac, you should also install XCode, which is a set of developer tools. You can get it from the App store, but it's better to set yourself up with  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then use homebrew to install XCode. If you prefer a different package manager, that's fine - Homebrew is widely used, but there are other options. Ultimately, you just need to have XCode so that you can compile R packages. \n\n```\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\n```\nbrew install mas # Search the apple store\nmas search xcode # find xcode\nmas install 497799835 # install the program by ID\n```\n\n2.  Download and install the latest version of [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n    -   {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows: **check the box that asks if you want to add Python to the system path.**\n        This will save you a *lot* of time and frustration. If you didn't do this, you can follow [these instructions](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) to fix the issue (you'll need to restart your machine).\n\n    -   If you're interested in python, you should install Jupyter using the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install) (I would just do `pip3 install jupyterlab`)\\\n        We will not use jupyter much in this book - I prefer quarto - but the python community has decided to distribute code primarily in jupyter notebooks, so having it on your machine may be useful so that you can run other people's code.\n\n    -   [Additional instructions for installing Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/install) from Python for Everybody if you have trouble.\n\n3.  Download and install the [latest version of RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) for your operating system.\n    RStudio is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, created by Posit.\n    It contains a set of tools designed to make writing R, python, javascript, and other data-related code easier.\n\n4.  Download and install the [latest version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/#getting-started) for your operating system.\n    Quarto is a command-line tool released by Posit that allows you to create documents using R or python, combining code, results, and written text.\n\nThe following steps may be necessary depending on which class you're in.\nIf you want to be safe, go ahead and complete these steps as well.\n\n5.  Install git using the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).\n    Consult the [troubleshooting guide](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) if you have issues.\n    If that fails, then seek help in office hours.\n\n6.  Install LaTeX and rmarkdown:\n\n    -   Launch R, and type the following commands into the console:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    install.packages(c(\"tinytex\", \"knitr\", \"rmarkdown\", \"quarto\"))\n    library(tinytex)\n    install_tinytex()\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Your turn {.unnumbered}\n\nOpen RStudio on your computer and explore a bit.\n\n-   Can you find the R console? Type in `2+2` to make sure the result is `4`.\n-   Run the following code in the R console:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\n  c(\"tidyverse\", \"rmarkdown\", \"knitr\", \"quarto\")\n)\n```\n\n-   Can you find the text editor?\n    -   Create a new quarto document (File -\\> New File -\\> Quarto Document).\n    -   Paste in the contents of [this document](../files/getting-started-r-python.qmd).\n    -   Compile the document (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K) and use the Viewer pane to see the result.\n    -   If this all worked, you have RStudio, Quarto, R, and Python set up correctly on your machine.\n:::\n",
