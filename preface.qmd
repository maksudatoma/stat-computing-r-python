# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Acknowledgements

The cover of this book is an amalgam of different images by the lovely [\@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst), which are released under the [cc-by 4.0 license](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/main/license). I have modified them to remove most of the R package references and arrange them to represent the topics covered in this book.

Throughout this book, I have borrowed liberally from other online tutorials, published books, and blog posts. I have tried to ensure that I link to the source material throughout the book and provide appropriate credit to anyone whose examples I have used, modified, or repurposed. Special thanks to the tutorials provided by Posit/RStudio and the tidyverse project.
